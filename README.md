# Covidulator
### Covid Footprint Calculator

Covidulator is a web app that calculates the impact of one's actions in regards to preventing the spread of COVID-19.

Our project took inspiration from the [Carbon Footprint Calculator](https://www.footprintcalculator.org/). We wanted to provide a
way for people to evaluate how well they are performing in face of the pandemic. Sometimes it can be difficult seeing other people
posting on social media about going out to large gatherings while in quarantine, so this provides a way to reassure them that their
performance is effective and helps out our community greatly. 

Created by Nicole Pham, Nathan Nguyen, Trisha Le, and Marawin Chheang \
Made for [ICSSC Jam for Change 2021](https://www.icssc-jamforchange.com/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
